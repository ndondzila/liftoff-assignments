# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app will firstly serve as a simple web page that allows a user to check if they perform well enough in weightlifting to qualify for regional and national level weightlifting competitions.  It will also link to tables displaying all qualifying totals in one page (usually one has to hunt down a table for each unique event).  Expanding on this, I will allow for profile building that requests various training movement results from users in order to give rudimentary advice on strengths and weaknesses.  The fully functioning application might be decorated with occasional statements or quotes of motivation for users so as to encourage them to pursue further achievement in the sport.

### Features
o	Qualification checking form: Simple HTML form allowing users to submit total and weight class (from drop-down list); redirects users to results page (whether or not they could qualify, etc.)
o	User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
o	Qualification tables: Users will be able browse the entire list of qualifying totals for USAW events.
o	Strengths/weaknesses: Users will be able to input various accessory movements and receive automated feedback based on subjectively established "ideal" ratios.

### Technologies
o	Java
o	Bootstrap
o	SpringBoot (AWS Server support?)
o	MySQL
o	Thymeleaf

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to become much more comfortable with Java object creation with models and controllers as well as linking to APIs.  I will need to learn how to utilize the above technologies/languages in tandem in order to create a persistent database for user accounts as well as holding onto the ‘qualifying totals’ and numbers used for strength/weakness calculation.
